Tiny REST API to give kudos to people, written in Go.

I have created this small app only for experiment purposes.
For the curious, it can be used as a tutorial/example to create an API in Go, or to experiment cloud technologies, with a sample (but realistic) app.

## Frameworks & technologies
* Go 1.18
* PostgreSQL 14

* [gin-tonic](https://github.com/gin-gonic)
* [pgx](https://github.com/jackc/pgx)
* [viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper)
